# Re:Delivery Core

Local, private package tracking from your email inbox.

This is the source core of the Re:Delivery project. This is extended in the Home Assistant add-on [here](https://github.com/proconlon/redelivery), but can be run standalone.

The config file is [config.yaml](config.yaml) and this includes the web page which can be accessed locally.
